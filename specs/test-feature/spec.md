# Test Feature: UI Interactions

This feature introduces interactive UI elements for testing and verification purposes.
The goal is to verify the autonomous loop's ability to implement simple UI interactions and logical transformations.

## Overview
The feature consists of two main components:
1. A visual "Blink" effect for the page.
2. A text transformation tool for "Sarcasm" generation.
